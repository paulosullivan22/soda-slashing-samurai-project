THis project is a 90s style arcade shooter game where the aim is to keep the streets clean by shooting as many soda cans as possible out of the sky. If a soda can touches the ground, the player loses a life. The game ends when the player is out of lives 

Soda cans fall at random intervals, interspersed with water bottles and juiceboxes. Players should avoid shooting waterbottles, which subtract 10 points from the score whilst aiming to hit juiceboxes which add an extra life. 

There are two characters to choose from, a Samurai or Chewbacca. Each character has a different gun and a different style bullet. 

This project was inspired by the arcade games I grew up playing as a child. If there are improvements to be made, don't hesitate to create a pull request.
