This project should include the following:

Background
Parallax background with different scroll rates 



Soda Cans
Images of soda cans flying from right to left across the screen at various heights and spacing, increasing in speed as the game progresses
If a soda can hits the 0 width or if the user clicks on a juicebox the user loses a life
Give soda cans different speeds 
If the user loses three lives, the game stops and they can restart


Create an obstacle that moves from left to right
Randomise the height that it appears
Create a loop that resends them
Use setInterval() to send multiple items at a decreasing interval

All objects should fall at a decreasing X-height to end up in the bottom left corner


Cursor and collisions
Mouse cursor of a samurai soda that animates on click, possibly restricting mouse movement over half the canvass

If the user clicks on a soda can, an animation occurs and the soda can disappears



Character Class
Possibly a character choice of a samurai or a jedi
